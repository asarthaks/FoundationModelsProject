Options include surgery, which is the primary treatment for early-stage melanomas. In some cases, lymph nodes may also be removed. Other treatments include immunotherapy, which boosts the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer; targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells; chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells; and radiation therapy, which uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells.

The exact cause isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Other factors that can increase your risk include having many moles or abnormal moles, a family history of melanoma, fair skin, a history of sunburn, living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation, and having a weak immune system."

These mutations can cause the cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors. The primary environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including sunlight and tanning beds, which can cause DNA damage in cells. Genetic factors, such as having a family history of melanoma and having certain gene mutations, can also increase risk."

These skin cells produce melanin, which is the pigment responsible for the color of the skin. Normally, melanocytes are distributed evenly throughout the basal layer of the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of the skin. With moles, there is an increase in the number of melanocytes that accumulate in a small area, forming a cluster of cells that causes a darker spot on the skin. Melanocytic nevi can be classified as congenital or acquired. Congenital melanocytic nevi are typically present at birth or may appear within the first few months of life. On the other hand, acquired nevi appear throughout life due to predisposing factors like familial tendency, sun exposure, and skin type, with higher nevus counts seen in individuals with lighter skin tones."

Most congenital nevi are small (i.e., diameter less than 1.5 centimeters [cm]) or medium-sized (i.e., diameter between 1.5 cm and 20 cm). However, they can sometimes measure greater than 20 cm in diameter and these are known as large, or giant, moles. Their color ranges from tan to black or blueish, and the borders are often irregular. One of the characteristic features of congenital nevi is that they usually have hair growing from them.  Acquired nevi, on the other hand, typically appear as brown, flat spots that may become raised over time and tend to be smaller than 6 millimeters in diameter (i.e., the size of a pencil eraser). They are usually symmetrical, with even borders, and consist of one single color. Acquired nevi are more common in sun-exposed areas, such as the trunk, arms, and lower legs, but they can appear anywhere on the body. Some nevi have unique characteristics and are referred to by their names. For example, Sutton nevus is a mole surrounded by a round or oval halo that is lighter in color than the rest of the skin. The Spitz nevus is a pink, red, or brown mole that has a dome shape and is most commonly found in the face and legs. Another example is blue nevus, a characteristic mole that has a blue color due to the location of melanocytes deep within the dermis."

            "How is this skin condition diagnosed?",
            "This is Melanocytic nevi. Melanocytic nevi are diagnosed based on the examination of the skin. Trained clinicians may use a magnifying tool called a dermatoscope to help detect features that are not visible to the naked eye. This can assist in the clinical diagnosis and help distinguish common nevi from atypical nevi, as well as malignant lesions like melanoma. Some dermatologists may also photograph certain nevi to monitor for changes over time if the diagnosis is unclear. Individuals who have many moles or who have a family history of melanoma may be recommended to perform self-skin examinations regularly to spot any changes within existing moles or the development of new lesions. A good way to check for suspicious nevi is to use the ABCDE rule. ABCDE stands for Asymmetry, Border irregularities, Color heterogeneity, Diameter over 6 millimeters, and Evolution, which refers to changes in size, color, or shape over time. The presence of one or more of these features indicates a higher chance of malignant transformation. For a definitive diagnosis of suspicious nevi, an excisional biopsy may be performed to rule out melanoma."

            "This is Melanocytic nevi. Most melanocytic nevi remain benign throughout a person\u2019s lifetime and require no treatment other than observation. However, several treatment options can help reduce the appearance of moles or remove them altogether in case of cosmetic concerns. Common treatments include surgical excision and laser therapy. Surgical removal may include shave excision, which involves \u201cshaving\u201d or removing the mole with a sharp blade. This technique is most effective in moles that affect only the epidermis and has the advantage of leaving minimal or no scarring. For deeper lesions, or in cases where there is a higher risk of malignancy, an excisional biopsy may be needed to remove the whole lesion. On the other hand, lasers work by emitting specific wavelengths of light that are absorbed by melanin. Melanin transforms the energy absorbed from the laser into heat that destroys the pigment in the skin, thereby decreasing the appearance of the mole. Some of the most effective ways to prevent the development of nevi include decreasing exposure to UV rays by wearing sun-protective clothing, using broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher; and avoiding artificial UV rays like tanning beds. Studies have shown these measures are especially effective during childhood and adolescence, which is when most melanocytic nevi are formed."

They can be present from birth or develop throughout one\u2019s life. While moles are completely benign lesions, having a large number of moles is considered a risk factor for melanoma. The ABCDE rule (i.e., Asymmetry, Borders, Color, Diameter, and Evolution) is an easy-to-remember guide that can help spot moles that may be cancerous. Most melanocytic nevi do not require any treatment other than observation, however, they can be removed with surgery or lasers if they cause cosmetic concerns."

            "What causes squamous cell carcinoma?",
            "Squamous cell carcinoma is primarily caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Other risk factors include a weakened immune system, exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., arsenic), chronic skin inflammation, and a history of previous skin cancers. Genetic predisposition and a fair skin type can also increase the risk."
